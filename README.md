# BankAccount

# 🏦 Python Banking System (OOP Project)

A fully object‑oriented banking system built in Python, featuring:

- BankAccount base class  
- SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount (inheritance)  
- Polymorphism via monthly updates  
- Transaction history  
- Error handling  
- Bank class for managing multiple accounts  
- Magic methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, comparisons)  
- File persistence (save/load JSON)

This project was built as part of my journey learning Python OOP.  
I designed the architecture myself and used online resources and AI tools for guidance and structure.
